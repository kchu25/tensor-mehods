Symmetric and Asymmetric tensor power iterations to estimate the parameters of the single topic model


Thoughts:
Robustness seemed to be a big problem associated with spectral methods; it seems like we can get "negative probabilities" if we don't have enough samples, or if the moment tensor has a large magnitude of perturbation.
